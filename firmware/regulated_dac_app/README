regulated_dac_app:
--------------------------------------------------------------------

An example application for use with the Frigate chip.

This application configures frigate_analog to instantiate a DAC which
is referenced from a supply-independent voltage reference of 2.56V,
such that the DAC output is in steps of 10mV.

This uses the CMOS voltage reference scaled output of 1.024V followed
by an amplifier stage with a gain of 2.5 to set the 2.56V reference
for the DAC.

See the description of the circuit setup in the "frigate_analog"
document.

This is a work in progress and is currently waiting on aspects of the
Frigate SoC definition to be completed.
