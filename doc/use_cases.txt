Use cases for Frigate Analog
--------------------------------------------

NOTE:  For simulation, it is sufficient that the default state of
all switch inputs is zero.  In actual operation, those switches
with 2-bit values may get reduced noise by turning on the shunt
to ground when the switch is off (value 2'b10).

Under no circumstance should a 2-bit switch value ever be set to
value 2'b11, as this effectively shorts certain module outputs
to ground.

Setup:  All analog digital input values should be zero on power-up
except for the following bits.  These bits affect the power-on-reset
operation, so failure to set the correct value will result in complete
chip failure:

		rc_osc_500k_ena = 1 (in the timing front-end)
	
		ldo_ena = 1
		bandgap_ena = 1

NOTES:  In the configuration descriptions below, when a pad is
	declared to be "turned off", it should be sufficient to
	set the pad cells' DM[2:0] mode to 3'b000.

1. ADC 0 operation 
	A. ADC low voltage reference comes from gpio6_7.  gpio6_7
	   may be turned off and driven to 0V externally, set as a
	   digital output with value 0, or set as a pull-down
	   digital input.

		adc_refl_to_gpio6_7[1:0] = 2'b01

	B. ADC high voltage reference comes from gpio6_6.  gpio6_6
	   may be turned off and driven to 3.3V externally, set as a
	   digital output with value 1, or set as a pull-up digital
	   input.

		adc_refh_to_gpio6_6[1:0] = 2'b01

	C. ADC 0 input can be sourced directly from either gpio6_4,
	   gpio1_3, or analog1.  ONLY ONE of these three sources
	   should be connected at any one time, or else the
	   sources will be shorted.  The switches can be used to
	   multiplex between sources.  Additional sources can be
	   used (such as from the user area, or voltage references
	   or temperature sensor output) but this description is
	   for checking the ADC with only external sources.
	
	   To connect the input to gpio6_4, the pad must be turned
	   off and the following switch set:

		adc0_to_gpio6_4[1:0] = 2'b01

	   To connect the input to gpio1_3, the pad must be turned
	   off and the following switch set:

		adc0_to_gpio1_3[1:0] = 2'b01

	   To connect the input to analog1, the following switches
	   should be set:

		adc0_to_analog1 = 1'b1
		analog1_connect = 2'b01

	The ADC in the analog section consists of a 12-bit CDAC,
	a sample-and-hold circuit, and a precision comparator.
	These have the following combined control signals:

		adc0_ena = 1'b1		enables the ADC sample-and-hold
		adc0_hold		apply to sample input value
		adc0_reset		toggle before start of conversion
		adc0_dac_val[11:0]	apply each successive value
		adc0_comp_out		read comparator result

2. ADC 1 operation 
	A. ADC low voltage reference comes from gpio6_7.  gpio6_7
	   may be turned off and driven to 0V externally, set as a
	   digital output with value 0, or set as a pull-down
	   digital input.

		adc_refl_to_gpio6_7[1:0] = 2'b01

	B. ADC high voltage reference comes from gpio6_6.  gpio6_6
	   may be turned off and driven to 3.3V externally, set as a
	   digital output with value 1, or set as a pull-up digital
	   input.

		adc_refh_to_gpio6_6[1:0] = 2'b01

	C. ADC 1 input can be sourced directly from either gpio6_5,
	   gpio1_2, or analog0.  ONLY ONE of these three sources
	   should be connected at any one time, or else the
	   sources will be shorted.  The switches can be used to
	   multiplex between sources.  Additional sources can be
	   used (such as from the user area, or voltage references
	   or temperature sensor output) but this description is
	   for checking the ADC with only external sources.
	
	   To connect the input to gpio6_5, the pad must be turned
	   off and the following switch set:

		adc1_to_gpio6_5[1:0] = 2'b01

	   To connect the input to gpio1_2, the pad must be turned
	   off and the following switch set:

		adc1_to_gpio1_2[1:0] = 2'b01

	   To connect the input to analog0, the following switch
	   should be set:

		adc1_to_analog0 = 1'b1
		analog0_connect = 2'b01

	The ADC in the analog section consists of a 12-bit CDAC,
	a sample-and-hold circuit, and a precision comparator.
	These have the following combined control signals:

		adc1_ena = 1'b1		enables the ADC sample-and-hold
		adc1_hold		apply to sample input value
		adc1_reset		toggle before start of conversion
		adc1_dac_val[11:0]	apply each successive value
		adc1_comp_out		read comparator result

3. DAC 0 operation 
	A. DAC low voltage reference comes from gpio6_7.  gpio6_7
	   may be turned off and driven to 0V externally, set as a
	   digital output with value 0, or set as a pull-down
	   digital input.

		dac_refl_to_gpio6_7[1:0] = 2'b01

	B. DAC high voltage reference comes from gpio1_1.  gpio1_1
	   may be turned off and driven to 3.3V externally, set as a
	   digital output with value 1, or set as a pull-up digital
	   input.

		dac_refh_to_gpio1_1[1:0] = 2'b01

	C. DAC 0 output can be connected directly to the analog1
	   pin.  This is the only pin which can be connected
	   directly to the DAC, although other pins are reachable
	   via connections to other modules (e.g., DAC 0 to
	   gpio6_4 by connecting to the ADC 0 input).  

	   To connect the input to analog1, the following switch
	   should be set:

		dac0_to_analog1 = 1'b1
		analog1_connect = 2'b01

	   Note that the DAC does not have a high-drive output and
	   is not intended to connect directly to a pin.  This use
	   case suffices for testing with care taken not to load
	   the output pin.  A more typical use is to route the DAC
	   output to an amplifier connected as a buffer.  For that
	   case, use, e.g.:

		ibias_ena = 1'b1
		ibias_src_ena[2] = 1'b1
		right_lp_opamp_p_to_dac0 = 1'b1
		right_lp_opamp_n_to_analog1 = 1'b1
		right_lp_to_analog1 = 2'b01
		analog1_connect = 2'b01

	   This setting uses the right-side operational amplifer
	   as a unity-gain buffer which buffers the DAC output
	   signal and outputs to the analog1 pin.

	D. DAC 0 has the following signal connections for the
	   operation:

		rdac0_ena = 1'b1	enables DAC 0
		rdac0_value[7:0]	apply the value to these bits

4. DAC 1 operation 
	A. DAC low voltage reference comes from gpio6_7.  gpio6_7
	   may be turned off and driven to 0V externally, set as a
	   digital output with value 0, or set as a pull-down
	   digital input.

		dac_refl_to_gpio6_7[1:0] = 2'b01

	B. DAC high voltage reference comes from gpio1_1.  gpio1_1
	   may be turned off and driven to 3.3V externally, set as a
	   digital output with value 1, or set as a pull-up digital
	   input.

		dac_refh_to_gpio1_1[1:0] = 2'b01

	C. DAC 1 output can be connected directly to the analog0
	   pin.  This is the only pin which can be connected
	   directly to the DAC, although other pins are reachable
	   via connections to other modules (e.g., DAC 1 to
	   gpio6_5 by connecting to the ADC 1 input).  

	   To connect the input to analog0, the following switch
	   should be set:

		dac1_to_analog0 = 1'b1
		analog0_connect = 2'b01

	   Note that the DAC does not have a high-drive output and
	   is not intended to connect directly to a pin.  This use
	   case suffices for testing with care taken not to load
	   the output pin.  However, unlike DAC 0, DAC 1 is
	   connected to the negative side of all the amplifiers,
	   making it difficult to configure as input to a unity-
	   gain buffer.  However, DAC 1 is appropriate to check
	   using a loop-back to ADC 1, with the following connections:

		adc1_to_dac1 = 1'b1

	   Then use ADC 1 as described above (except for the input
	   selection, as the setting above connects the ADC 1 input
	   to the DAC 1 output).

	D. DAC 1 has the following signal connections for the
	   operation:

		rdac1_ena = 1'b1	enables DAC 1
		rdac1_value[7:0]	apply the value to these bits

5. AudioDAC operation 

	The audioDAC is defined entirely in verilog up to the output
	driver stage, which is the only component in the analog block.
	The audioDAC digital output is complementary and connects to
	the frigate_analog block through

		audiodac_in		positive signal
		audiodac_inb		negative signal

	The audioDAC driver is simply a chain of buffers and a value-
	holding latch, so it does not require an enable signal.  It
	connects only do the analog0/analog1 outputs.  Both switches
	should be enabled at the same time.

		audiodac_out_to_analog1 = 2'b01
		audiodac_outb_to_analog0 = 2'b01

6. Guide to bias currents

	A number of components in the analog section are driven by
	bias currents generated by the sky130_ef_ip__biasgen3 block.
	The control for this block is mainly a 24-bit enable vector.
	The table mapping vector bits to components is given below.

		ibias_ena = 1'b1	enables the bias generator
		ibias_ref_select	see below

		ibias_src_ena[0]	enable left lp op amp bias 100nA
		ibias_src_ena[1]	left lp op amp +50nA trim 
		ibias_src_ena[2]	enable right lp op amp bias 100nA
		ibias_src_ena[3]	right lp op amp +50nA trim 
		ibias_src_ena[4]	enable left hgbw op amp bias 100nA
		ibias_src_ena[5]	left hgbw op amp +50nA trim 
		ibias_src_ena[6]	enable right hgbw op amp bias 100nA
		ibias_src_ena[7]	right hgbw op amp +50nA trim 
		ibias_src_ena[8]	enable left instr amp bias 100nA
		ibias_src_ena[9]	left instr amp +50nA trim 
		ibias_src_ena[10]	enable right instr amp bias 100nA
		ibias_src_ena[11]	right instr amp bias +50nA trim 
		ibias_src_ena[12]	32kHz XO (LSXO) bias 50nA
		ibias_src_ena[13]	4-16MHz XO (HSXO) bias 1uA
		ibias_src_ena[14]	HSXO +50nA trim
		ibias_src_ena[15]	Precision comparator bias 400nA
		ibias_src_ena[16]	Precision comparator +50nA trim
		ibias_src_ena[17]	Overvoltage detector bias 600nA
		ibias_src_ena[18]	iDAC bias 1uA (unused)
		ibias_src_ena[19]	Brownout detector bias 200nA
		ibias_src_ena[20]	User1 bias 50nA
		ibias_src_ena[21]	User2 bias 150nA
		ibias_src_ena[22]	User2 bias +50nA trim
		ibias_src_ena[23]	Test output current 500nA to gpio1_2

		ibias_snk_ena[0]	HSXO -100nA trim
		ibias_snk_ena[1]	Comparator -100nA trim
		ibias_snk_ena[2]	User2 bias -100nA trim
		ibias_snk_ena[3]	Test output current -100nA trim

	The bias generator output is normally stabilized by the bandgap
	reference voltage.  However, it also has a selection for an
	adjustable bias using vdda1 as the adjustment, which is the
	default.  Nominally the vdda1 value should be 3.3V (the normal
	vdda1 voltage).
		
		ibias_ref_select = 1'b0	select vdda1 as reference voltage
		vdda1 = 3.3V		reference voltage (see above)

		ibias_ref_select = 1'b1	select bandgap as reference voltage
